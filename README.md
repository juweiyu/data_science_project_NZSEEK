# NZ Seek Data Visualisation

## NZ seek datasets
Our NZ seek raw datasets include newly released admin jobs, banking jobs, and CEO jobs across New Zealand. They can be found in https://github.com/juweiyu/data_science_project_NZSEEK/tree/main/data%20source/raw%20data.

The raw dataset is irregulated and imcomplete, and hence it requires data preprocessing. Cleaned datasets can be found in  https://github.com/juweiyu/data_science_project_NZSEEK/tree/main/data%20source/cleaned%20data.
